## This was my attempt at building a game fully in Assembly
* At that point I used WinAsm and in general the windows assembly macro ecosystem since that was what we used for our Assembly language programming class.
* I got so far as to load the OpenGL library and a couple of dynamically linked functions as to be able to render a triangle.
